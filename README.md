- 👋 Hi, I’m @samuelsur
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning
- 🌱 I’m currently studying a Master's program Cybernetics and Robotics at [CTU](https://intranet.fel.cvut.cz/en/)
- 📫 How to reach me: [samuelsur.xyz](https://www.samuelsur.xyz/)
- If you are interested in my bachelor's project -> [Classification detection and matching of skin lesions](https://gitlab.fel.cvut.cz/sursamue/bakalarska_praca)
- Semestral work from course Diagnostics and Testing -> [Automated System for Bearing Fault Detection From Vibration Signals](https://gitlab.fel.cvut.cz/sursamue/bearing-fault-detection)
- Group project at CIIRC -> https://gitlab.fel.cvut.cz/sursamue/robot-camera-semantic-segmentation
    - the task was to create software for collison avoidance for a robot
    - my taks in this group was to train a neural network for semantic segmentaiton of robot's surroundings
